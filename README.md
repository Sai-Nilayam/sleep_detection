Base Description

This project contians codes for Sleep Detection. The way it's intended to be worked is that give a video of m seconds it will detect if the person has slept of not. 

The main usage of the project is to be implemented to smart TVs. Most of smart TVs are coming or are supposed to come with camera with a OS installed. It's possible to make an app that will automatically turn off the TV if the person watching it get slept.

This will help in the following way.
1. The Electrical Energy will be saved.
2. The TV noise will be turned of providing the user with a better sleeping experience. 

Please feel free to raise any issue for it. Soon I will make available a video tutorial that exaplains how to use the project and how to tweak this repo as per your need. Any contribution is welcome. 

Please raise an issue if you get.
